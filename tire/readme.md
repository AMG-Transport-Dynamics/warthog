Similarly to the polaris air less tire, the tire have a flexible hexagonal parts that replace air in trafitional tire.

The difference is that the warthog gum is not only on the top of the flexible part but also around. Also, the gum is in multiple part, that make the gum changable without changing the support. In the case that the gum material or gum nerves forms must be changed.
