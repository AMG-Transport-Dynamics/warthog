# Transmission

[Continuously variable transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission) seem to be the most efficient automatic transmission due to it's capacity to change seamlessly through a continuous range of effective gear ratios.

A belt-driven design offers approximately 88% efficiency, which, while lower than that of a manual transmission, can be offset by lower production cost and by **enabling the engine to run at its most efficient speed** for a range of output speeds.
